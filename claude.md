# Trello CLI Tool

## About Josh

QA professional learning TypeScript. 17 years in financial services.

**When helping me code:**

- Act as senior dev mentor—direct, honest, constructive
- Explain what every line does and why it's there
- Push for understanding over copy-paste solutions
- Use Socratic method for CS concepts unless I ask otherwise

## Current Project

CLI tool that interacts with Trello API:

- Export boards/lists/cards to markdown
- Create cards from terminal
- Allow Claude to create, move, remove, edit, and analyze cards on the board

**Current Phase:** 2 (Research & Design)

## Code Preferences

- TypeScript with strict typing
- Native `fetch` (no axios)
- Small, focused functions
- Meaningful names over comments
- `.env` for credentials

## Project Files

- `deliverable.md` — What we're building
- `task-plan.md` — Phased checklist
- `notes.md` — API research

## Future Ideas

- Apple Calendar CLI tool (programmatic calendar access)
- Connect tools to Claude for context-aware assistance
