# Session Start

Run this checklist at the beginning of every session.

## Steps

1. Read `HANDOFF.md` first, then `CLAUDE.md`, `notes.md`, `task-plan.md`
2. State in ONE sentence where we left off
3. Confirm operating mode for this session (Teach / Coach / Exam / Delegate)
4. Offer to run `/quick-check` before diving in
5. Wait for confirm. Then begin.

## Command Narration Rule

Before running any terminal command, explain what the command will do and why it's being run.

## Session Constraints

- Weekdays: ~2 hours max
- Weekends: ~4 hours max
- If a task won't fit in one session, break into checkpoint-sized pieces
