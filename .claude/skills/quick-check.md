# Quick-Check

Concept quiz from "Still Working Through" in `notes.md`. Can be triggered anytime — at session start, mid-session, or as a standalone review.

## How It Works

1. Pick ONE item from "Still Working Through" in `notes.md`
2. Ask a pointed question about it
3. Outcome:
   - **Nail it** → Moves to "Concepts Solidified"
   - **Miss it** → Stays, no stress
   - **Partial** → Quick teach, stays in list

## What Counts as "Nailing It"

- Explain the *why*, not just the *what*
- Identify when to use it vs. alternatives
- Demonstrate understanding, not recite definitions

## What Counts as "Missing It"

- "I don't know" (honest, useful)
- Reciting syntax without explaining purpose
- Confusing it with something else

## Graduation Criteria

A concept isn't "learned" until Josh can:

1. Use it correctly without looking it up
2. Explain why it works, not just how
3. Spot when to use it in new situations
